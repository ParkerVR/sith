**Last Updated: December 13, 2024**

## Overview

Sith is a time tracking application for macOS that respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

Sith collects the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Application Names**: Names of applications you use while tracking time
- **Time Tracking Data**: Timestamps and duration of time spent in tracked applications
- **User Preferences**: Your settings including allowed applications, idle timeout, and display preferences

### What We Don't Collect

- We do **not** collect any personal information
- We do **not** collect the content of your work (documents, files, keystrokes, etc.)
- We do **not** track websites you visit or specific activities within applications
- We do **not** send any data to external servers
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking services
- We do **not** share your data with third parties

## Data Storage

All data collected by Sith is stored **locally on your Mac** in your Application Support directory. No data is transmitted to external servers or cloud services.

**Storage Location**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sith/`

## Data Usage

The data collected is used solely to:

- Display your current work session time
- Show which application you're currently using
- Generate daily summaries of your work time
- Remember your preferences and settings

## Permissions

### Apple Events (Automation)

Sith requests permission to detect the currently active application. This permission is:

- **Required** for the app to function
- **Used only** to identify which application is active
- **Never used** to access application content or data
- **Never transmitted** outside your device

You can revoke this permission at any time in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**.

## Data Retention

- Time tracking data is stored indefinitely on your device unless you manually delete it
- You can reset your time tracking data at any time through the app menu
- Uninstalling the app does not automatically delete stored data

## Data Deletion

To delete all data collected by Sith:

1. **Manual deletion**: Navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/Sith/` and delete the folder
2. **Reset in app**: Use the "Reset Time" option in the app menu to clear current session data

## Children's Privacy

Sith does not knowingly collect any data from children. The app is designed for general productivity use and does not target children specifically.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of Sith after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

As all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can:

- Access your data at any time
- Modify your settings and preferences
- Delete all collected data
- Stop using the app at any time

## Third-Party Services

Sith does not integrate with or use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks.

## Data Security

All data is stored on your local device using standard macOS security features. Sith does not implement additional encryption as:

- All data remains on your device
- macOS provides system-level security (FileVault, permissions, etc.)
- No sensitive personal information is collected

---

**Summary**: Sith collects only application names and time tracking data, stores everything locally on your Mac, never sends data anywhere, and gives you complete control over your information.
